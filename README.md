# Comparison of Calculating Core Number of Each Node in a Large Undirected Graph using Doubly Linked List Implementation and NetworkX library

## Prerequisites
- networkx
- collections defaultdict

## Instruction

1. Make sure that com-amazon.txt is in the same folder.
2. Execute this line on the terminal and the path of directory of the folder
   "python .\Q4_3.py"
3. The file are running algorithm to compute core_numbers of each node by:
    - using my own method from scratch -> "result_own.txt"
    - using networkx library -> "result_networkx.txt"
    - comparing the results of both txt file generated

## Outputs
    ========= Own Method =========
    Total Duration Own:  5.613739 s
    ========= NetworkX Method =========
    Total Duration NetworkX:  5.144641 s
